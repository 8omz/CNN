# 🚗 Self-Driving Car Simulation using JavaScript (STILL WORKING ON IT)

## Overview
This project is a self-driving car simulation built using JavaScript, neural networks, and machine learning. The primary aim is to create a basic yet functional self-driving car model that can navigate through a simulated environment, detect obstacles, and respond to collisions.

## Features
- **🧠 Neural Networks**: Utilizes neural networks to simulate decision-making processes.
- **🚧 Collision Detection**: Implements advanced collision detection using geometric algorithms.
- **🚦 Dynamic Environment**: Supports a dynamic environment with traffic simulation.
## Learning Objectives
By working on this project, I am learning:
- **📜 JavaScript**: Deepening my understanding of modern JavaScript features such as ES6 syntax, array methods.
- **🧠 Neural Networks**: Gaining practical experience in implementing and training neural networks for real-time decision-making.
- **📏 Collision Detection**: Learning geometric algorithms for detecting intersections and handling collisions.
- **📊 Simulation and Visualization**: Understanding how to create dynamic simulations and visualize complex data in real-time.

## Future Enhancements
In future iterations, I plan to add:
- **🧠 Improved Neural Network**: Enhance the neural network's learning algorithm for better decision-making.
- **🚦 Traffic Simulation**: Add more sophisticated traffic patterns and behaviors to create a more challenging environment.
- **🛑 Obstacle generartion**: Implement advanced obstacle generation.
- **🖥️ User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for easier interaction and configuration of the simulation parameters (Pause,play,etc...).
- **⚡ Performance Optimization**: Optimize the code for better performance, especially when handling multiple cars and complex environments (It does get laggy when creating over 1000+ cars).

## Usage
To run the simulation, open the `index.html` file in your web browser (Or just use the github.io link in the description above 😁). Once inside you'll see a 'How it works' section on the left, that should give you the tools needed to use and understand it.

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by a tutorial that provided a comprehensive guide to building a self-driving car simulation using JavaScript. Special thanks to the tutorial creator for their detailed explanations and guidance. 🙏
